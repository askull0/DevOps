# Lab Tasks Overview

In the "instruction_to_lab" directory there are detailed instructions for lab tasks


# lab 1
The goal of the lab was to familiarize with Git, SSH key configuration, branch creation, implementing a Git hook, and working with a repository using HTTPS and SSH.

# lab 2
The goal of the lab was to familiarize with Docker, creating and running containers, building images from Dockerfile, and managing containers and images.

# lab3
The goal of the lab was to learn about building and testing applications in Docker containers, creating Dockerfiles for building and running tests, and using Docker Compose to manage multiple services.

# lab4
The goal of the lab was to work with Docker volumes, expose ports, set up a Jenkins instance in a container, and explore communication between containers. It also includes advanced tasks like handling services (e.g., SSH) in containers and understanding Jenkins dependencies for Docker and Docker Compose.

# lab5
The goal of the lab was to set up Jenkins for automating build and test processes using Docker containers and Jenkins Pipelines. It involves creating containers for building and testing, integrating them with Jenkins, and using Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline steps.

# lab6
Lab 06 focuses on completing the CI/CD pipeline. It also involves defining a deploy container, running a smoke test to verify the app, and publishing the artifact (e.g., Docker container or binary). 

# lab7
This lab focused on using Ansible for automation, setting up remote command execution, and managing containers. Tasks included configuring SSH connectivity, executing remote commands, and handling container deployments with storage and ports.

# lab8
The goal of the lab was to create an answer file for the installation of an operating system that automatically installs necessary software and runs the program on a virtual machine without user intervention.

# lab9
The goal of the lab was to set up and manage a local Kubernetes cluster, deploy a Docker container on that cluster.

# lab10
The goal of this lab was to convert a manual deployment into a declarative YAML configuration, enhance the image with additional replicas, and deploy it using kubectl apply. Additionally, the session involved managing image versions, applying updates to the deployment, and utilizing kubectl commands to handle rollbacks, versioning, and ensuring the deployment runs smoothly within the Kubernetes cluster.

# lab11
This lab focused on testing various Kubernetes deployment strategies (Recreate, Rolling Update, Blue/Green, Canary). Using Minikube, the goal was to compare deployment times and pod behavior, identifying the fastest strategies and understanding their performance differences.

# lab12
This lab involved deploying a Docker container in Azure, including updating the container, creating a resource group, and using Azure Container Instances for deployment.
